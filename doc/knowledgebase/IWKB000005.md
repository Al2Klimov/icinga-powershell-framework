## Reason

The `icingapowershell` service of the `Icinga for Windows` solution is unable to locate `powershell.exe`. The service is using `powershell.exe` natively without any directory configuration and looking up the `PATH` variable which normally includes a path like `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0` which contains the required `powershell.exe`

## Solution

To resolve this issue, ensure that your `PATH` environment variable is containing a directory which inherits a `powershell.exe`. By default, this should be `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0`.

You can check this by opening a PowerShell by running the following command:

```powershell
($ENV:Path).Split(';')
```

If there is no directory listed containing a `powershell.exe`, you will have to add this path manually. You can either use the UI for this or modify and run the following PowerShell code within an Administrator shell to add a new path permanently to the `PATH` variable by modifying the registry:

```powershell
# The variable containing the folder we want to include
$PathDir = 'please enter the path here';

# Read PATH from registry
$CurrentPath = (Get-ItemProperty `
    -Path 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment' `
    -Name 'PATH'
).path;

# Add our defined path to the CurrentPath variable
$CurrentPath = [string]::Format('{0};{1}', $CurrentPath, $PathDir);

# Write the modified Path into the registry
Set-ItemProperty `
    -Path 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment' `
    -Name 'PATH' `
    -Value $CurrentPath;
```

Now open a new PowerShell session again and check of the new directory was added:

```powershell
($ENV:Path).Split(';')
```

Once the directory is there, restart the `icingapowershell` service by running

```powershell
Restart-Service 'icingapowershell'
```

Now the error should be resolved the the service should be running.
